# Hi, challenger.
# Finding the shortest path is a relevant topic at the present. This topic is widely used in everyday life: searching for the shortest path from one point to another, in GPS when analyzing traffic congestion and choosing the optimal route, in switching information packets on networks, and so on. There are many ways to apply this topic in life.

# Very often a person has to visit several places, and for this, it is necessary to think over the optimal path. The pace of human life is often intense: work, occasions, business meetings, hobbies, etc. This is an important issue that needs automation. Nowadays, keeping up with everything, correctly allocating time and the optimal path is an exact science.

# Good luck!
